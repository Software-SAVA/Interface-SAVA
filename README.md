# Interface-SAVA

Languages: English and Portuguese
Graphical interface for calculating IWV

This project is helpful for new users interested in calculating the IWV (integrated water vapor content of the atmosphere). The interface simplifies the processes of using the GIPSY processing package version X-rc02 for the exclusive study of IWV. It is noteworthy that the GIPSY package must be licensed with JPL independently of the SAVA interface. SAVA allows the operator to “Open” a RINEX observation file for processing then processing is performed.

Wherever SAVA extracts all the necessary information to get supplementary files, builds the processing tree to run GIPSY, and generator the zenith wet and total delay time series and the IWV.

The ephemeris, bias and ionospheric map files and the output file generated by SAVA are also available for viewing.
The main python packages needed are presented below.
